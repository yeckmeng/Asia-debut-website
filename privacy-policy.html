                        <h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
                        <p>

                            <br>
                            Protecting the individual's privacy on the Internet is crucial to the future of Internet-based business and the move toward a true Internet economy. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to the individual`s rights to data protection and privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual ("Personal Data").
                            <br><br>
                            A. General Information<br>
                            This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data that you provide to Asia Debut or which is derived from the Personal Data as outlined below. The use of and any information that is gathered by cookies or other web tracking technologies is subject to the disclosures.
                            The data controller of the Asia Debut mobile application and website is Asia Debut , 118-1, Jalan Damai Raya 2 Taman Damai Circles 56000 Cheras  Kuala Lumpur (“Asia Debut ”). Where a client registration form is presented on this website or during a meeting with our representative, the data controller may vary depending on the actual offering or the purpose of the data collection but it is in any case displayed on the individual registration form’s privacy policy.
                            Asia Debut will process the Personal Data provided hereunder only as set out in this privacy policy. Further information can be found in Sections B. and C. below. Where the processing of your Personal Data is based on a statutory permission, you can find information on which Personal Data Asia Debut is processing or using for which purposes in Section B below. Where consent for the processing of your Personal Data is required you can find further information in Section C. below.
                            Where Asia Debut is processing and using your Personal Data as permitted by law (see B. below) or under your consent (see C. below), Asia Debut will store your Personal Data (i) only for as long as is required to fulfil the purposes set out below or (ii) until you object to Asia Debut ’s use of your Personal Data (where Asia Debut has a legitimate interest in using your Personal Data), or (iii) until you withdraw your consent (where you consented to Asia Debut using your Personal Data). However, where Asia Debut is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer or where your Personal Data is required for Asia Debut to assert or defend against legal claims, Asia Debut will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.
                            As a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any Personal Data hereunder is entirely voluntary; there are generally no detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Data. However, there are circumstances in which Asia Debut cannot take action without certain Personal Data, for example because this Personal Data is required to process your orders or provide you with access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for Asia Debut to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Data.
                            Asia Debut has affiliates and third-party service providers within as well as outside of the Malaysia. As a consequence, whenever Asia Debut is using or otherwise processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, Asia Debut may transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the Malaysia including to such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the Malaysia.
                            You can request from Asia Debut at any time information about which Personal Data Asia Debut processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data. Please note, however, that Asia Debut can delete your Personal Data only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of Asia Debut to retain it. Kindly note that if you request that Asia Debut delete your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to use any Asia Debut service that requires Asia Debut ’s use of your Personal Data.
                            If Asia Debut uses your Personal Data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from Asia Debut a copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to Asia Debut . Asia Debut will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how it can best fulfil it.
                            Furthermore, you can request from Asia Debut that Asia Debut restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events:
                            (i) you state that the Personal Data Asia Debut has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long as Asia Debut requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data),
                            (ii) there is no legal basis for Asia Debut processing your Personal Data and you demand that Asia Debut restricts your Personal Data from further processing,
                            (iii) Asia Debut no longer requires your Personal Data but you claim that you require Asia Debut to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims or
                            (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by Asia Debut (based on Asia Debut ’s legitimate interest as further set out in B. below) for as long as it is required to review as to whether Asia Debut has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.
                            If you believe that Asia Debut is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable Malaysia data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of Malaysia in which you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state in which Asia Debut has its registered seat.
                            Use of this website by children. This website is not intended for anyone under the age of 18 years. If you are younger than 18, you may not register with or use this website. ()
                            Links to other websites. This website may contain links to foreign (meaning non-Asia Debut Group companies) websites.

                            <br><br>
                            B. Where Asia Debut uses Personal Data based on the Law.<br>
                            In the following cases, Asia Debut is permitted to process your Personal Data under the applicable data protection law.
                            Providing the requested goods or services. If you order goods or services from Asia Debut , Asia Debut will use the Personal Data that you enter into the order or registration form (usually (a subset of) your name, (email) address, telephone number, company name and address, your job title and role and, if payment is to be made to Asia Debut , credit card number or bank details) only to process your order or to provide the requested goods or service. This may include taking the necessary steps prior to entering into the contract, responding to your related inquiries, and providing you with shipping and billing information and to process or provide customer feedback and support. This may also include conversation data that you may trigger via the chat functionalities on or other local Asia Debut web presences, contact forms, emails, or telephone. In this privacy policy, “goods and services” includes (access to) Asia Debut ’s web services, offerings, contests, sweepstakes, other content, non-marketing related newsletters, whitepapers, tutorials, trainings and events.
                            Furthermore, we communicate on a regular basis by email with users who subscribe to our services, and we may also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We may use your email address to confirm your opening of an account, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law.
                            Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, which are not marketing-related but merely required for the relevant business relationship. With regard to marketing-related types of communication (i.e. emails and phone calls), Asia Debut will (i) where legally required only provide you with such information after you have opted in and (ii) provide you the opportunity to opt out if you do not want to receive further marketing-related types of communication from us. You can opt out of these at any time.
                            Asia Debut and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of America. You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued by these countries, Asia Debut is required to take measures to prevent entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through Asia Debut ’s websites or other delivery channels controlled by Asia Debut . This may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to Asia Debut ’s services and systems in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match.
                            Furthermore, you acknowledge that any information required to track your choices regarding the processing or use of your Personal Data or receipt of marketing materials may be stored and exchanged between members of the Asia Debut as required to ensure compliance.
                            Each of the use cases below constitutes a legitimate interest of Asia Debut to process or use your Personal Data. If you do not agree with this approach, you may object against Asia Debut ’s processing or use of your Personal Data as set out below.
                            Asia Debut may invite you to participate in questionnaires and surveys. These questionnaires and surveys will be generally designed in a way that they can be answered without any Personal Data. If you nonetheless enter Personal Data in a questionnaire or survey, Asia Debut may use such Personal Data to improve its products and services.
                            Asia Debut may anonymize Personal Data provided under this privacy policy to create anonymized data sets, which will then be used to improve its products and services.
                            In case of telephone calls or chat sessions, Asia Debut may record such calls (after informing you accordingly during that call and before the recording starts) or chat sessions in order to improve the quality of Asia Debut ’s services.
                            In order to keep you up-to-date/request feedback. Within an existing business relationship between you and Asia Debut , Asia Debut may inform you, where permitted in accordance with local laws, about its products or services which are similar or related to such products and services you have already purchased or used from Asia Debut . Furthermore, where you have attended a webinar, seminar or event of Asia Debut or purchased products or services from Asia Debut , Asia Debut may contact you for feedback regarding the improvement of the relevant product or service.
                            You may object to Asia Debut using Personal Data for the above purposes at any time. If you do so, Asia Debut will cease using your Personal Data for the above purposes (that is to say, under a legitimate interest set out above) and remove it from its systems unless Asia Debut is permitted to use such Personal Data for another purpose set out in this privacy policy or Asia Debut determines and demonstrates a compelling legitimate interest to continue processing your Personal Data.
                            <br><br>
                            C. Where Asia Debut uses My Personal Data based on Client’s Consent<br>
                            In the following cases Asia Debut will only use your Personal Data as further detailed below after you have granted your prior consent into the relevant processing operations. Therefore, each information about a processing operation with regard to Personal Data is linked to one consent statement in the Consent Resource Center. If you re-open this Privacy Policy after you have initially one or more consents granted you will not only see the information related to the consents you have granted but the full privacy policy.
                            Subject to a respective provision and your consent, Asia Debut may use your name, email and postal address, telephone number, job title and basic information about your employer (name, address, and industry) as well as an interaction profile based on prior interactions with Asia Debut in order to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, software upgrades, special offers, and other information about Asia Debut ’s software and services (including marketing-related newsletters) as well as events of Asia Debut and in order to display relevant content on Asia Debut ’s websites. In connection with these marketing-related activities, Asia Debut may provide a hashed user ID to third party operated social networks or other web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or Google) where this information is then matched against the social networks’ data or the web offerings’ own data bases in order to display to you more relevant information.
                            Asia Debut offers you the option to use its web offerings including forums, blogs, and networks linked to this website that require you to register and create a user profile. User profiles provide the option to display personal information about you to other users, including but not limited to your name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, or both, telephone number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your company.
                            These profiles may relate to a single web offering of Asia Debut may also allow you to access other web offerings of Asia Debut or of other entities of the Asia Debut Group, or both (irrespective of any consent granted under the section “Forwarding your Personal Data to other Asia Debut companies.” below). It is, however, always your choice which of these additional web offerings you use and your Personal Data is only forwarded to them once you initially access them. Kindly note that without your consent for Asia Debut to create such user profiles Asia Debut will not be in a position to offer such services to you where your consent is a statutory requirement that Asia Debut can provide these services to you.
                            Within any web offering, beyond the mere provision of access your profile is used to personalize interaction with other users (for example, by way of messaging or follow functionality) and by Asia Debut to foster the quality of communication and collaboration through such offerings and for Asia Debut to provide gamification elements (gamification is the process of taking something that already exists, such as a website, an enterprise application, or an online community, and integrating game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, and loyalty). To the greatest extent supported by the relevant web offering, you can use the functionality of the relevant web offering to determine which information you want to share.
                            In connection with the registration for and provision of access to an event or seminar, Asia Debut may ask for information about your health for the purpose of identifying and being considerate of individuals who have disabilities or special dietary requirements throughout the event. Any such use of information is based on the consent you grant hereunder.
                            Kindly note that if you do not provide any such information about disabilities or special dietary requirements, Asia Debut will not be able to take any respective precautions.
                            Asia Debut may transfer your Personal Data to other entities. In such cases, these entities will then use the Personal Data for the same purposes and under the same conditions as outlined in this Section C above.
                            You may at any time withdraw a consent granted hereunder by unsubscribing. In case of withdrawal, Asia Debut will not process Personal Data subject to this consent any longer unless legally required to do so. In case Asia Debut is required to retain your Personal Data for legal reasons your Personal Data will be restricted from further processing and only retained for the term required by law. However, any withdrawal has no effect on past processing of personal data by Asia Debut up to the point in time of your withdrawal. Furthermore, if your use of an Asia Debut offering requires your prior consent, Asia Debut will not be (any longer) able to provide the relevant service, offer or event to you after your revocation.
